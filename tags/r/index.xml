      <description>MotivationRecommender systems are a surprisingly large part of lives. As consumers weâ€™re faced with endless choices for music, clothing, etc. and it can often lead to what psychologists call Decision Fatigue. In a sentence, it is the idea that the opportunity cost of considering all items on a menu becomes so high that the quality of decision-making drops. Naturally, retailers and media providers are incentivized to limit the amount of items they show to a consumer, so the question of ranking item importance becomes highly relevant.</description>
