      <description>MotivationOne of my colleagues has been working on a project analysing a particular type of student survey data. The data is partitioned into a handful of sub-surveys measuring (essentially) different categorizations of non-cognitive skills and personality/learning traits. One aim of the project was to evaluate how combinations of metrics from the individual tests could be used to predict student outcomes. There were over 100 variables he was intending to analyze, many of which had seemingly overlapping definitions, so collinearity was a big concern going into it.</description>
